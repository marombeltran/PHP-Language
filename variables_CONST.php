<?php
/* Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable. 
 * The variable name is case-sensitive.
 */

/* By default, variables are always assigned by value. That is to say, when you assign an expression 
 * to a variable, the entire value of the original expression is copied into the destination variable. 
 * This means, for instance, that after assigning one variable's value to another, changing one of 
 * those variables will have no effect on the other.
 */

/* Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. A valid variable name starts with 
 * a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. 
 * As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: ^[a-zA-Z_\x80-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x80-\xff]*$
