 * Expressions
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Expressions are the most important building blocks of PHP. In PHP, almost anything you write
 * is an expression. The simplest yet most accurate way to define an expression is "anything
 * that has a value".

 * Every single expression in PHP has one of the following built-in types depending on its value:
 * - null
 * - bool [true, false, TRUE, FALSE]
 * - int
 * - float (floating-point number)
 * - string
 * - array
 * - object
 * - callable
 * - resource
